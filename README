Abomination Macros
(C) 2014 Christian Gunderman

PURPOSE:
Shows exactly how bad you can mess up C when you start playing with macros
excessively. You really should NEVER do this, but I did because I was curious
just how closely you can model Visual Basic type languages in C.

USAGE:
Include abomination.h to define visual basic-like macros. example.c is a hello
world application written entirely in the macros.

NOTE:
Not really a huge fan of VB and I don't recommend using these macros in any
actual code. It is a curiousity at best. A thought experiment.
