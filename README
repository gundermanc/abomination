Abomination Macros
(C) 2014 Christian Gunderman

PURPOSE:
Shows exactly how bad you can mess up C when you start playing with macros
excessively. You really should NEVER do this, but I did because I was curious
just how closely you can model Visual Basic type languages
and OOP in C.

NOTE:
Not really a huge fan of VB and I don't recommend using these macros in any
actual code. It is a curiousity at best. A thought experiment.
If you use this in ACTUAL code, you should probably cover your mouth with one 
hand and your nose with another and hold it that way until things go dark ;)
